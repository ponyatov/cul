\secrel{Principles}\label{princ}

\begin{itemize}
    \item the language for engineering and real-world applications
    \begin{itemize}
        \item units and tolerance
        \item deployment management
    \end{itemize}
    \item cross-compile first
    \begin{itemize}
        \item limited subset of the language targets on very small devices
        \begin{itemize}
            \item STM32F0/F1 4..20K RAM
            \item Arduino-like
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item programming language for
    \begin{itemize}
        \item heterogeneous computer clusters,
        \item mesh networks, and
        \item firmware for tiny embedded devices
    \end{itemize}
    \item interactive graphical environment for
    \begin{itemize}
        \item complex GUI development
        \item IDE,
        \item graphical tooling and vector CAD
    \end{itemize}
    \item memory persistence as data storage
    \item as close as possible
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hard real-time
        \item runs on detached networks
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
